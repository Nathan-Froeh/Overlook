# OverLook

OverLook is a solo project meant ot be the final project from Mod 2 of Turing school of software and design. The learning goals were to get comfortable with using Fetch, WebPack, and SASS propperly while getting further experience designing and building a project from the ground up using OOP and TDD.

OverLook is a hotel management software that is meant to be mobile friendly and simple to use. OverLook has the ability to display many of the hotel's stats by general and be specific days and customers, modify past customers and add new ones, book and unbook rooms as well as up/downgrade rooms, and even order room service, all from one simple app. I used my experience using CRM's in the past as well as some research into real world hotel management app's to influence the UI/UX.
